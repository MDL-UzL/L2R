# L2R/examples
Repository for L2R examples 

So far, we provide the following examples:
* AbdomenCTCT: We first train a segmentation network as features extractor, followed by a two-step training registration network
* NLST: A ResNet/UNet-Combination. You can find its performance at https://learn2reg.grand-challenge.org/evaluation/task1-extended-labels/leaderboard/ (NLST Example)
